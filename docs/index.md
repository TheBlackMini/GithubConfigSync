A Home Assistant **add-on** for syncing your config folder to GitHub. This is
a **config sync tool, not a backup tool**.

!!! danger "Keep the repository private"

    Private repositories are strongly recommended. Use caution with public
    repos and any two-way sync tools that also write to your Home Assistant
    config tree — they can cause local config loss or unexpected deletions.

## What this add-on does

- GitHub authentication with least privilege: your own GitHub App (device flow), the default OAuth Device Flow, or a fine-grained PAT
- Wizard-style setup and per-section reconfiguration with a dark-mode UI
- Create a new repository or use an existing one
- Sync your Home Assistant config folder to GitHub
- Auto-generate a Home Assistant-friendly `.gitignore`
- Customizable ignore patterns
- Manual sync button in Home Assistant
- Scheduled syncs (day-of-week + time-of-day selection)
- Optional dated GitHub release creation before each sync
- Clean Upload — force full re-upload and remove remote extras
- Clean Repo — wipe remote repo and restore starter files in one step
- Repository picker with safety checks to avoid accidental overwrites
- Sensitive-file scanning and reporting
