# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.7.1

- **Fix**: Status polling is now adaptive (refresh every 30s while idle, every 2s only during an active sync) instead of hard-polling every 2s — copy/paste in the UI is no longer interrupted and error messages no longer get wiped seconds after they appear.
- **Fix**: Errors from device-flow login and repository loading now stay on screen in a dismissible banner instead of vanishing.
- **Fix**: The GitHub App is now the default auth method; the stale example Client ID was removed from the UI and docs.
- **Fix**: "Save Connect settings" button is right-aligned.
- **Fix**: Wizard sections are no longer collapsible and the "Installation and Usage" header was removed.
- **Fix**: The Repository tab's "Load Repositories" now loads all repositories (public and private, including adopted ones) and refreshes the picker.

## 1.7.0

- **Feature**: New least-privilege auth method — use your own GitHub App (device flow, Client ID only, no client secret): it asks only for Metadata (read-only) and Contents (read and write) on repositories you choose, and GitHub shows the app name you set instead of the maintainer's default.
- **Feature**: Web UI is now a setup wizard (Connect GitHub → Repository → What to sync → Schedule & safety → Review) with per-section save buttons in the settings view and a "Re-run wizard" option; the old auto-save-on-every-keystroke (which snapped the page back to the top on refresh) is gone.
- **Feature**: Dark mode follows the Home Assistant/system theme by default, with a Theme toggle (Auto / Light / Dark) in the header.
- **Fix**: Recommended .gitignore entries render beside their checkboxes instead of being right-aligned.
- **Fix**: The Stable/Dev version boxes were removed from the top of the page — the installed version stays in the header badge.

## 1.6.2

- **Chore**: Version bumps now promote the top "Unreleased" changelog section into the released version, keeping the repo-root, add-on, and app changelogs in sync (via `scripts/sync_versions.py`).
- **Chore**: Release notes are now published as GitHub releases (`vX.Y.Z`) so the Home Assistant update page shows only the changelog differences between the installed version and the update (`scripts/create_release.py`).

## 1.6.1

- **Feature**: Allow-list ("whitelist") sync mode is now meaningful and enabled by default — only files matching the configured include patterns are synced, so unrelated files never end up in the repo. Patterns are owned per installation: editable `*.yaml`-style lists for includes, excludes, and clean-upload preserve paths (new `sync_include_patterns`, `sync_exclude_patterns`, `clean_preserve_paths` options).
- **Fix**: Files that fall off the allow-list (or are excluded/preserved) are no longer deleted from GitHub — unmatched remote files are left untouched during normal and clean uploads.
- **Fix**: Clean upload no longer deletes the entire repository tree — only files in the current sync scope are removed; extra/unrelated repo files are preserved.
- **Fix**: An empty allow-list is respected as "sync nothing" instead of "sync everything to be safe".
- **Security**: Saved GitHub token at rest is now encrypted (Fernet) using the supervisor machine-id-derived key, on all persistence paths (web UI options, Supervisor options). Falls back to plaintext with a warning only when `cryptography` is unavailable; tokens stay masked as `********` in the UI.
- **Fix**: Scheduler no longer misbehaves in containers whose timezone differs from the user's — new `scheduler_timezone` option (IANA name, e.g. `Europe/Berlin`) controls when scheduled syncs run; defaults to server local time.
- **Fix**: GitHub API calls are rate-limited to one request every 0.25s globally and the sync engine uses fewer parallel workers, reducing secondary rate-limit errors during large uploads.
- **Fix**: Log lines are redacted with the same secret patterns as the diagnostics export before they are written to the sync log.
- **Fix**: Device Flow OAuth client ID is now configurable in the add-on UI and options (`github_client_id`) instead of only being hardcoded.
- **Chore**: Removed the duplicated `DEFAULT_IGNORE_PATTERNS` from the legacy `custom_components` stub (`sync/hashing.py` is the single source of truth).
- **Chore**: Removed the unused `sync_interval_minutes` option (leftover from the pre-scheduler era).
- **Feature**: A pre-commit gate runs inside the add-on before anything is pushed — files about to be uploaded are copied into a throwaway worktree and checked with pre-commit hooks before any GitHub write happens. Config comes from `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the Home Assistant config folder (fallback: bundled offline builtin hooks), and a new `precommit_mode` option (`enabled` / `warn` / `disabled`) controls whether violations block the push, are logged only, or are skipped. Uses the fast Rust pre-commit runner `prek`, keyed to a cached hook store under `/data/.prek`.
- **Breaking**: Official support is now limited to `amd64` and `aarch64` (the Home Assistant base image is multi-arch and armv7/armhf/i386 support is deprecated, so those architectures are no longer published). Base image updated to `ghcr.io/home-assistant/base:3.24-2026.08.0`.
- **Chore**: Added pre-commit with secret scanning (gitleaks), a gitleaks GitHub Action, Dependabot, and issue templates.

## 1.6.0

- **Feature**: Reset to Defaults button for ignore patterns in web UI
- **Fix**: Reset to Defaults button for ignore patterns was missing event handler (Uncaught TypeError)
- **Fix**: Add-on rebuild via Supervisor API now works correctly

## 1.5.22

- **Fix**: "Token missing" badge no longer appears when the token is actually fine — a transient GitHub check failure (`error` state) now shows as an amber "Token check failed" badge instead of the red "Token missing", and `/api/status` degrades it back to "Checking token..." so the status poll can never misreport a lost token
- **Fix**: One slow or timed-out GitHub call no longer poisons the token badge for 5 minutes — transient `error` health results are cached for 30s (stable states keep the 5-minute cache), so the badge self-corrects quickly
- **Fix**: Device Flow completion no longer reports "request timed out" mid-authorization — the UI now waits up to 130s for the exchange (server polls GitHub up to 120s) instead of aborting at 10s while the token was still being saved in the background
- **Fix**: Live token health check now uses a bounded 20s GitHub call with a 30s client timeout, so the real result reaches the UI instead of being aborted client-side at 10s
- **Fix**: Auth section no longer expands/collapses confusingly after login — it collapses once a token is present (rate-limited/check-error included), and only stays open for a genuinely missing or expired token
- **Fix**: `_save_state()` is now serialized with a lock so concurrent status polls / sync-progress writes can no longer race and drop the token-health cache entry

## 1.5.21

- **Fix**: Options now actually persist across add-on restarts — Supervisor sync POSTs `{"options": ...}` to `/addons/self/options` (self-alias, no slug needed) so it works for any `hassio_role`, fixing the previously wrong slug (`github_config_sync_web`) and unwrapped payload shape
- **Fix**: `hassio_api: true` added to `config.yaml` so `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` is injected into the container — without it the Supervisor sync silently skipped and the token was lost on reboot
- **Fix**: `set_options()` guards against a client echoing the masked `********` token placeholder, so a settings save can never overwrite the real saved token with the mask

## 1.5.20

- **Fix**: `/api/status` no longer performs a live GitHub call — it reads token health only from the state cache, so the 2-second status poll (and page-load render) can never be blocked by a slow or failing GitHub API request
- **Fix**: Added dedicated public `/api/token/health` endpoint for the live GitHub token check
- **Fix**: Frontend calls `/api/token/health` on a 60-second throttle (page load, visibility change, settings save, device-flow completion) instead of every status poll; `fetchJson` now aborts hung requests after 10s

## 1.5.19

- **Fix**: `_via_ingress_proxy()` now checks `X-Hass-Source: core.ingress` + private IP FIRST (primary), Supervisor IP fallback — works regardless of Docker networking changes
- **Fix**: Frontend fetches version from `/api/health` BEFORE Promise.allSettled — version shows instantly, no waiting for GitHub API call in `/api/status`
- **Fix**: `/api/health` now returns `repo_versions` for early fetch
- **Fix**: Removed dead code in `_token_health()`, IPv6 support in `_is_private_ip()`, visibility change loads both status + options

## 1.5.18

- **Fix**: Removed dead code in `_token_health()` (three unreachable return blocks from merge conflict)
- **Fix**: Page-load Promise.allSettled no longer bails on `loadOptions()` auth failure — versions now display before auth
- **Fix**: Visibility change handler now calls both `loadStatus()` and `loadOptions()` to restore full UI state
- **Fix**: IPv6 support in `_is_private_ip()` (ULA fc00::/7, link-local fe80::/10, loopback ::1)
- **Fix**: Supervisor sync token persistence across restarts

## 1.5.17

- **Fix**: `/api/status` is public (no auth) — returns version info so versions display on UI load before authentication

## 1.5.16

- **Fix**: `/api/status` is now public (no auth required) — returns version info, repo versions, and token_health so versions display before user authenticates

## 1.5.15

- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `_persist_options` function definition (second definition was overwriting the first)
- **Fix**: Token now persists across restarts via both Supervisor config store and webui_options.json

## 1.5.14

- **Fix**: Re-added Supervisor option sync with graceful error handling — token now synced to Supervisor config store after device flow completion and settings update, surviving add-on restarts
- **Fix**: Graceful Supervisor API error handling (logs warning on 403/other errors, doesn't crash)

## 1.5.13

- **Fix**: Token health check cache key now uses stable SHA256 (not Python's randomized hash()) — cache now persists across restarts, stopping 2s polling from hitting GitHub rate limits after the first successful check

## 1.5.12

- **Fix**: Token health check cache key uses hash(token) to avoid issues with short tokens
- **Fix**: Improved rate limit detection in token health check — checks for multiple keywords (rate limit, secondary rate limit, abuse detection, x-ratelimit-remaining, x-ratelimit-reset) in error body
- **Fix**: Added warning log for failed token health checks to aid debugging

## 1.5.11

- **Fix**: Token health check now caches results (5 min valid / 30s errors), distinguishes rate limits from auth failures, and returns a `rate_limited` state instead of collapsing into `expired`
- **Fix**: Frontend handles `rate_limited` state — shows "Rate limited" badge, doesn't auto-collapse auth section, pauses polling when tab/iframe hidden (visibilitychange), resumes on visibility restore

## 1.5.10

- **Fix**: Removed failing Supervisor API sync call (403 Forbidden) — token persists via webui_options.json which _merge_options() already reads

## 1.5.9

- **Debug**: Added detailed logging for Supervisor option sync and ingress auth checks to diagnose token persistence issues

## 1.5.8

- **Fix**: Token from device flow now synced to Supervisor — persists across add-on restarts and UI navigation

## 1.5.7

- **Fix**: Device flow endpoints (`/api/auth/device*`) no longer require authentication — they bootstrap the GitHub token (regression in 1.5.6 where device login was broken)
- **Fix**: `sync_mode` validation in payload (must be `whitelist` or `blacklist`)
- **Fix**: Device flow token exchange caps `slow_down` retries at 10 (previously unbounded)

## 1.5.6

- **Security fix**: API authentication now works. Requests are trusted as ingress-authenticated only when they originate from the Supervisor proxy (peer-address check) — the legacy IngressSession header check, which no Home Assistant version sets, was removed
- All GET API endpoints now require authentication (via ingress or Bearer github_token); previously only POST endpoints were guarded
- Fixed sync_versions.py: now updates hacs.json and PROJECT.md, and no longer rewrites a stale APP_VERSION constant in server.py (version is auto-read from config.yaml)
- Removed duplicated 1.5.4 entries from this changelog

## 1.5.5

- **Security fix**: Sensitive file scanning now actually blocks uploads (was previously report-only after sync)
- Added is_sensitive_candidate() name-pattern check to is_ignored() in build_hash_index
- Added content scanning (_is_file_sensitive) to build_hash_index to detect embedded secrets in file contents
- Fixed misleading SECURITY_UPLOAD_WARNINGS.md message (now accurate since files are actually skipped)
- scan_sensitive_files() now finds all sensitive files regardless of ignore status (for warning purposes)
- Removed dead code: _require_ingress decorator and SyncEngine._delete_remote_tree_except
- Added _require_auth guard on all POST endpoints (ingress token or configured github_token Bearer)
- Path safety checks now use is_relative_to instead of string prefix matching
- Retry with exponential backoff on transient GitHub 5xx errors (500/502/503/504)
- Pinned base image to ghcr.io/home-assistant/base:3.24-2026.06.1 (reproducible builds)
- Version read failure now logs a warning instead of silently falling back to 0.0.0
- Legacy custom_components stripped to redirect-only (no parallel sync implementation)

## 1.5.3

- Security hardening: all include_* options (include_ssl, include_addon_configs, etc.) now default to false
- Added include_ssl and include_addon_configs to built-in ignore directories
- Added core.config_entries and .env to built-in ignore patterns
- Token now syncs from HA config entry to add-on via Supervisor API (fixes auth persistence issue)
- Version auto-read from config.yaml via regex — single source of truth
- Reset to Defaults button for .gitignore patterns in web UI

## 1.5.2

- Removed "Auto-sync pushes changes" toggle — scheduled sync always pushes when enabled
- Removed Troubleshooting options section
- Added Skipped (unchanged) count to sync activity display
- SHA conflict retries with backoff (up to 3 attempts)
- Version auto-read from config.yaml — single source of truth
- Reworded skeleton README

## 1.2.0

- Feature: auto-sync scheduler — runs sync on a configurable interval in the background
- Scheduler re-reads settings each cycle, so interval/token/branch changes take effect immediately

## 1.1.3

- Fix: removed ingress header validation — breaks when HA is behind a reverse proxy that strips headers. HA ingress URL token alone is sufficient authentication.

## 1.1.2

- Fix: removed ingress requirement from device auth endpoints. Device flow was blocked by the security hardening in 1.1.1, preventing GitHub login from completing.

## 1.1.1

- Security hardening: ingress header validation on mutating API endpoints.
